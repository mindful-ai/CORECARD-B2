Subject line: Senior Customer Service Representative Seeks Customer Service Team Lead Position with XYZ (Job ID #888701)

Dear Marcus,
 
Please find attached a copy of my resume for the Customer Service Team Lead Position with XYZ.
As a Senior CSR with ABC Corp, I’ve designed and supervised phone and online surveying activities 
prior to the launch of our new line of products. The result? In 7 months I’ve raised 
customer experience phone survey ratings by 58% and boosted customer retention by 27%. 
I’m sure I can translate my 9+ years of CS experience into similar results for XYZ.
Can we schedule a meeting next week to discuss solutions for making XYZ’s Customer 
Service operations more cost-effective and raising your NPS ratings in the upcoming months?

 

Sincerely,
Cynthia McKittrick
 
Senior Customer Service Representative
